1. Test FLI:
-OEI -> 

2. RPM indicator:
-Rotor RPM indication doesn't work

3. Wrong cyclic control reflection: 
-When breakout to right -> 3D Model breaks forward
-When breakout to left -> 3D Model breaks aft
-When breakout to forward-> 3D Model doesn't move
-When breakout to aft -> 3D Model doesn't move

4. Test slope landing 

5. Add mast moment warning sound 

6. Remove cautions from panel

7. Skids sinking in the ground
	-The pilots feel that they sitting to low.
	-Slope landing very hard

8. Engine fail sounds

9. Yaw string not correct

10. To much left pedal

11. FLI 
	- overtrq gong
	-always OEI indication

12. Engi Oilpressure 0

13. To high trq changes when moving pedals

14. Left pedal to weak



Test mit Roland:
	cg x -> -3.17 ; y -> -0.07
	fmc: attitude_hold -> on

	scas -> gains:
		1. attitude: x = 0.01745, y = 0.01745, z = 0
		2. rate: x = 0.00524, y = 0.00873, z = 0.01047
